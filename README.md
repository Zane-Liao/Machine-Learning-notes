# Machine Learning Notes
- This repository mainly contains the steps of commonly used machine learning algorithms, and also contains some summary notes from the Internet and myself. I intend to use it as a Cookbook in machine learning for easy review, including but not limited to traditional supervised learning, unsupervised learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, Transformer, diffusion model, building LLM and fine-tuning RAG and other technologies.
- I will write my notes in a very colloquial way (I like simplicity) and I will not use too much academic terms (except for some very rigorous definitions and mathematics).
